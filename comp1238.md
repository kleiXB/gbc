## Week 1 - History
- Cuneiform: One of the earliest known writing systems, used in Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE. It was wedge-shaped and used for recording transactions and literature like the Epic of Gilgamesh.

- Epic of Gilgamesh: An ancient Mesopotamian epic that explores themes of mortality, friendship, and the quest for immortality. It was rediscovered in the 19th century.

- Writing Evolution: Writing systems evolved independently in different regions (e.g., Chinese, Mesoamerican), with some influenced by earlier systems like Sumerian cuneiform.

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Binary System: Computers use binary (base-2) to represent data, where each bit can be 0 or 1. Groups of 8 bits form a byte.

- ASCII Encoding: A standard for representing characters in computers using 7 bits (128 characters), including control codes like newline and tab.

- Memory Types: Volatile memory (RAM) is fast but temporary, while non-volatile memory (storage) retains data even when powered off.

## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Markup Languages: Tools like HTML, XML, and Markdown use tags to structure and format text. HTML is the backbone of the web, while Markdown is simpler and used for documentation.

- JSON and XML: Text-based formats for structured data. JSON is lightweight and commonly used in web APIs, while XML is more verbose and used in older systems.

- Special Characters: Non-alphanumeric characters like '#', '{', and '\' have special meanings in markup and programming languages. Escaping (e.g., '\#') is used to treat them as literal characters.

## Week 4 - Typing and Searching
- Touch Typing: Typing without looking at the keyboard improves speed and reduces strain. Practice tools like Ratatype or Keybr can help.

- Regular Expressions (RegEx): A powerful tool for pattern matching in text. Basic syntax includes . (any character), '[abc]' (any of a, b, c), and '\d' (any digit).

- Text Editors: Tools like VSCode, Notepad, and Vim are used for editing plain text files. IDEs (e.g., WebStorm, PyCharm) combine text editing with additional development tools.

## Week 5 - Command Line Interface (CLI)
- CLI Basics: Commands like 'ls' (list files), 'cd' (change directory), and 'grep' (search text) are essential for navigating and managing files in a terminal.

- SSH: Secure Shell allows remote access to servers. Commands like 'scp' and 'sftp' are used for secure file transfers.

- Unix Philosophy: Programs should do one thing well and work together via text streams. Tools like 'htop' and 'tmux' enhance CLI productivity.
